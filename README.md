                       my firebase server and all datas in firebase written by me 
                       覺 used provider package as state management "
                      it has a night mode and many ui features "
                      覺 used shared preferences, firebase core , cloud_firestore,firebase_stroge,curved_navigation_bar,carousel_slider,and autosizetext packages 
                      as you can see there is optimization problem that is everytime 覺 change page the images download again 覺 didnt find the solution
